This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Approach

- Fonts are loaded locally in `app/globals.css` with `@font-face` and utility classes like `font-atomos`, `font-atomos-solid`, `font-voltec`, `font-megaton` 
- then i used it whenever the font needed properly 
- i made all the component diffrenet for the reuseable purpose like card, leaderboard etc... 
- made the object for the data so it can be changable easily

### How to change common items
- I made the object for the all data in each file so it will be easy to change.
- Hero title/description/button: edit `pageContent.hero` in `app/page.tsx`.
- for each section/component



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
